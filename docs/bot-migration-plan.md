# MindMate Telegram Bot Migration Plan (Dev -> Production)

## Goal
Move your **current daily-use bot** (currently the “dev bot”) into a **stable production setup** with a production-looking bot identity, while preserving user memory stored in Redis.

Given your constraints:
- Only **1 real user + you**
- Users care mostly about **Redis memory**, not Telegram chat history

This plan aims to:
- Avoid breaking the current experience for the daily user.
- Create a clean workflow where `main` is stable and feature work doesn’t disturb users.

---

## Target End State (Recommended)

### Production (Public)
- **Telegram bot**: New production-looking username (create a new bot)
- **Render service**: `mindmate-prod`
- **Git branch**: `main`
- **Database/Redis**: Prod Redis

### Staging/Dev (Internal)
- **Telegram bot**: Keep your existing dev bot (or create a new “staging” bot)
- **Render service**: `mindmate-dev`
- **Git branch**: `develop` (recommended) or current integration branch
- **Database/Redis**: Dev Redis

Why: Telegram bot usernames cannot be changed, so the only way to avoid a “dev-looking” username is to use a new bot.

---

## Phase 0 — Pre-flight Checklist (15 minutes)

- [ ] Confirm which bot is the current daily-use bot (the one your partner uses).
- [ ] Confirm current Render mapping:
  - [ ] `mindmate-dev` -> dev bot token -> dev Redis
  - [ ] `mindmate-prod` -> prod bot token -> prod Redis
- [ ] Decide your new public bot username (check availability in BotFather).

> Note: Do **not** delete old bots/services yet. We’ll keep rollback options.

---

## Phase 1 — Create the New Production Telegram Bot (10 minutes)

1. In Telegram, open **@BotFather**.
2. Create a new bot:
   - Command: `/newbot`
   - Choose a **production-looking username** (no “dev”).
3. Save the new bot token securely.

Deliverable:
- New **production bot token** ready to be added to Render.

---

## Phase 2 — Point Production Render Service to the New Bot (15–30 minutes)

1. Go to Render dashboard → your **production service** (`mindmate-prod`).
2. Set environment variables:
   - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` = **new production bot token**
   - Ensure it points to the **prod Redis/database**, not dev
   - If you have an `ENV` variable, set it to `production`
3. Deploy `mindmate-prod` from `main`.
4. Test:
   - Start chat with the new production bot
   - Confirm `/start` and basic conversation works
   - Confirm memory write/read is working (a short conversation, then ask a recall-style question)

Rollback option:
- You can revert env vars back to the old token if something goes wrong.

---

## Phase 3 — Migrate Memory (Dev Redis -> Prod Redis) (Optional but Recommended)

Because you only have **1 real user**, the simplest and safest approach is:

### Option A (Simplest): Manual “seed memory”
- Ask the user to copy/paste their key context.
- You seed it as “initial profile” in the new bot.

### Option B (Recommended): Scripted migration by Telegram `user_id`
Migrate the user’s Redis keys from dev namespace to prod namespace.

High-level steps:
1. Identify how memory is keyed in Redis (common patterns):
   - `user:{id}:history`
   - `memory:{id}`
   - `conversation:{id}`
2. Export keys for your user_id from dev Redis.
3. Import into prod Redis under the same structure.
4. Validate by asking the new production bot questions that depend on memory.

Safety notes:
- Make a snapshot/export of dev keys before importing.
- Prefer **copy** over **move** (non-destructive).

Deliverable:
- User memory available in the new production bot.

---

## Phase 4 — Transition the Daily User (5 minutes)

1. In the old dev bot, send a final message:
   - “Official bot moved here: https://t.me/<new_prod_username>”
2. Ask the user to:
   - Start the new bot
   - Run `/start`
3. Confirm:
   - Their core memory is present (if you migrated)
   - They’re comfortable switching

Because they don’t care about chat history, this is typically painless.

---

## Phase 5 — Fix Your Workflow So You Don’t Break Daily Users Again

### Recommended Git flow (lightweight)
- `main`
  - Always stable
  - Deploys to production bot (`mindmate-prod`)
- `develop`
  - Integration branch
  - Deploys to staging bot (`mindmate-dev`)
- `feature/<name>`
  - Your work branches
  - Merge into `develop` first

Release process:
1. Develop features on `feature/<name>`.
2. Merge into `develop` → test on staging bot.
3. When stable, merge `develop` → `main`.
4. Deploy production.

### Operational guardrails (high impact)
- Add an `ENV` env var and print it on startup logs.
- Use different Redis key prefixes per environment, e.g.:
  - `dev:*` vs `prod:*`
- Don’t push breaking changes straight into whatever bot real users rely on.

---

## Phase 6 — Cleanup (Optional, only after a few days)

After the user is fully moved:
- Keep the old dev bot as staging/internal.
- Or create a new bot specifically named staging, e.g. `@mindmate_staging_bot`.

Do **not** delete the old bot immediately; keep it as rollback for at least 1–2 weeks.

---

## Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] New production bot exists with correct username.
- [ ] `mindmate-prod` points to new production bot token.
- [ ] Prod bot works end-to-end.
- [ ] Memory migration done (or manual seed done).
- [ ] Daily user successfully transitioned.
- [ ] `develop`/`feature/*` workflow in place so daily user isn’t disturbed.

## Notes / Decisions
- Production bot username: ___________________________
- Staging bot username (existing): ___________________
- Keep old production bot (`@mywellnesscompanion_bot`) as: rollback / archive / other: ___________________
